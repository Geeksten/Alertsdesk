##Synopsis

*Alertsdesk is a fullstack web application designed for tracking user generated info about illnesses and other health related alerts

*Integration of Google Maps API allows users to dynamically display the location of each alert

*Users can also get a list of alerts by zipcode

*A dynamic chart summarizes the illness trends using the number of reports querying by reported symptoms

*Alertsdesk uses the OpenWeather API to provide current weather information for given zipcode

##Technology Stack

* [SQLite] - Database contains Users and Userreports
* [SQLAlchemy] - Streamlines database queries
* [Python] - Backend code that manipulates incoming data, controls access to the database, and serves data to the webpage through a framework
* [Flask] - Lightweight web framework which also provides support for jinja templating and unittests
* [Javascript] - Frontend code which allows for dynamic webpages, used to map reports ny latitude and longitude
* [jQuery] - A Javascript library that simplifies DOM manipulation, including creating event handlers for user interaction
* [AJAX] - Gets information from server without reloading the page, allowing for more dynamic pages and faster loading    times
* [OpenWeather API] - Uses JSON to provide weather information
* [Google Maps API] - Uses geoJSON passed from the server to create dynamic reports.
* [HTML] - Displays information on the web
* [CSS] - Styles webpages
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - Frontend UI framework for quick styling
